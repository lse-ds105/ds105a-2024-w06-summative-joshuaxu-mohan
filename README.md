# What you will find here
In this repository, you will find Jupyter Notebook(s), jpg of visualised data and more to answer the question: 
## "Is London really as raining as the movies make it out to be? "

# How I will be approaching this question
In order to answer this question, it is clear that I have to compare the weather of London with other cities in the world, using OpenMeteo's free API.
**To answer yes would require London to be a clear outlier in terms of 'raininess' when compared with other cities** 
To do this, the parameters of the comparison is as follows:
- **Time Period** - 2023-01-01 to 2024-01-01
- **Other Cities** - 10 other cities will be chosen using a random capital city generator from https://perchance.org/capital-city (for now)
- **'Raininess** - Porportion of the year where there is precipitation according to OpenMeteo
- **OpenMeteo Variables** - Precipitation (rain + showers + snow) and Rain for now
